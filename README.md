Members of the [LVCSP](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/lvcsp) create and manage technical content in this [TC GitHub repository](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/lvcsp) as part of the TC's chartered work the program of work and deliverables described in its [charter](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/lvcsp/charter.php).

OASIS TC GitHub repositories, as described in [GitHub Repositories for OASIS TC Members' Chartered Work](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/tcadmin/github-repositories-for-oasis-tc-members-chartered-work), are governed by the OASIS [TC Process](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process), [IPR Policy](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr), and other policies. While they make use of public GitHub repositories, these repositories are distinct from [OASIS Open Repositories](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories), which are used for development of open source [licensed](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/licenses) content.

## Description

The purpose of this repository is to support version control for Work Product artifacts developed by members of the OASIS LVCSP TC,
including prose specification editing and secondary artifacts like meeting minutes, productivity code, etc.
The TC's proposal and approval is available online per [email to the TC mailing list](https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/lvcsp/202311/msg00000.html) and in the JIRA request form.

## Purpose statement 
  The LVCSP TC aims to define a lightweight identity credential schema, based on the W3C Verifiable Credential (VC) standard,
to enable individuals (VC subjects) to share their verified identity attestations across different platforms and services.
Any entity involved in issuing or consuming verifiable credentials referring to a defined business process will benefit from this work.

The LVCSP TC will create the following deliverables:

- A schema for a VC issued upon completion of an identity verification business process as follows:
- The VC will include or reference the business process (i.e., steps), but will not include the
corresponding PII gathered in the process.
- Deliverable formats will include JSON schemas and JSON-LD contexts
Assumes the issuerâ€™s authorization to issue this credential under this process/framework
(i.e., semantically corresponds to the authorization to issue)
- Informative examples of representative use cases
- (informative) example defined process
- (informative) issuer/RP semantics
- Including reliance and governance considerations
- (informative) verification procedure that an RP would follow, including subject authentication
- An informative description of how a relying party would verify integrity and authenticity of the VC.
- Security analysis of the supported schema

Where possible, the TC generally will rely on existing, widely used definitions and industry practices.

Other deliverables that fall within the scope of the project may be identified over time as the TC engages in its work.

The TC may re-factor the deliverables above as it sees fit into fewer, more, or differently combined documents. In any case, the deliverables shall:
- Be vendor-neutral and product-agnostic.
(The TC may also elect to provide proof-of-concept instances but will strive to facilitate
ease of implementation regardless of data schema choices.)
- To the extent feasible, re-use rather than re-invent suitable existing definitions of
policy concepts such as identity tokens and personally identifiable data.
- Describe with specificity their application to established US NIST and European eIDAS levels of assurance.
